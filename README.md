You can set you unique master phrase in any language using UTF-8 to generate your own sequence of passwords. It allows to restore all passwords using only one master phrase which must be stored in a safe place. For example, you input a "word1 word2 word3 ... wordN" master phrase and generate M passwords of Q symbols each. Next you can enumerate each password and match for them appropriate service (e-mail, market etc) and login. This information can be written into a sheet and stored separately.
