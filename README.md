# Cipher@Blat 128-bit

Passwords generator with ~128-bit strength.

You can set an unique master phrase in any language using UTF-8 to generate your own sequence of passwords. It allows to restore all passwords using only one master phrase which must be stored in a safe place. For example, you input a "word1 word2 word3 ... wordN" master phrase and generate M passwords of Q symbols each. Next you can number passwords and assign a service and login to each. This information should be written down on a piece of paper and kept separately.
